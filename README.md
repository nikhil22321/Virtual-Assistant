# 🗣️ Virtual Assistant

An intelligent and interactive voice-based virtual assistant that greets users, takes voice input, responds to user queries based on a trained model, and executes commands like opening YouTube or other applications. Built using **Python**, it combines machine learning, speech recognition, and natural language processing for a real-time assistant experience.

## 🚀 Features

🧠 **Smart Interaction**  
- Greets users with voice on startup.  
- Understands and responds to questions using trained intents (`intents.json`).  
- Can open popular apps (e.g., YouTube, Chrome) with voice commands.

🎙️ **Voice Capabilities**  
- Converts speech to text using `SpeechRecognition`.  
- Responds using `pyttsx3` (text-to-speech).  
- Works offline after initial setup.

🧠 **Machine Learning Model**  
- Trained on custom intents using TensorFlow/Keras.  
- Uses tokenization and label encoding for accurate predictions.  
- Easily extendable to new intents and commands.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Python 3.8+**  
- **TensorFlow / Keras** – for neural network training  
- **NLTK** – for NLP preprocessing  
- **SpeechRecognition** – for capturing user voice  
- **pyttsx3** – for voice output  
- **pickle / JSON** – for storing and loading encoders and models
